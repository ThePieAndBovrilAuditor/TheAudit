# TheAudit

This code scrapes Pie and Bovril users posts and green/red dots and represents it graphically.

There is some rudimentary timezone correction that needs to be applied once the person being audited tells you where they live. This did work for e.g. American and Australian posters but I must have overwritten the file at some point as it's only set up to correct American timezones at the moment, will fix at some point.

For dots you need to log into P&B, code is at the start of Dotting History.r
